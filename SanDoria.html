Rochefogne : Hmm ? and they must be Royal Knights... Swiftly do they return to Chateau d'Oraguille, 

++ rochefogne et moi
Rochefogne :  You, Too, must learn the differance between the Temple Knights and the Royal Knights, if you are to bear San D'Orian citizenship ! 

Rochefogne : The Temple Knights shield the capital, while the Royal Knights strike at our foes!
++Rochefogne 
Rochefogne : i heard mention in my travels that Prince Trion had assumed control of the Royal Knights.

Rochefogne : Yes, Trion... Of him i have heard naught for ages. I do hope the princes are well
Rochefogne : And princess Claidie! Fair is said to be the younger sister of Trion and Pieuje. Prehaps someday i may meet her!

But, I ramble. Maybe pardons!

So long have i been away that my head races. Well, adventure proudly for San d'Oria, and your blade shall never falter
Oh, Before i foget... i give you this for your journeys. Show it to Matildie, who stands before the drawbridge to Chateau d'Oraguille
She might be a tab more critical than most, so you might want to be careful.
I will pin her on your map
Now, I must go and seeks entrance to the castle. May we meet again, Storyman!
